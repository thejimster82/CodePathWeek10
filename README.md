## Honeypots Deployed
I chose to only deploy the basic Dionaea HTTP honeypot since I didn't have a ton of extra time this week.
## Issues Encountered
I had an issue where I couldn't load the MHN interface through my browser because my GCP settings weren't allowing incoming traffic. My TA was able to help me get it working.
## Summary of Data Collected
Having the page open for only around 15 minutes, I was able to record over 3 pages of attacks frpm a huge range of countries. Later on I got bombarded by attackers from China for some reason.

## Unresolved Questions
I lack the understanding right now of how the attackers would actually find my site so fast, do they have scanning code that searches for any site with related data or is it MHN that sends out signals that attract these kind of attackers?
